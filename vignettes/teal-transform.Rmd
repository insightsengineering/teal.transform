## Introduction

The `teal.transform` package is an integral component of the `teal` framework. It serves a dual purpose:

- For `teal` module developers, it offers a standardized user interface for column selection from datasets and facilitates dataset merging, resulting in the creation of analysis datasets for use within their modules.
- For `teal` application developers, it provides a means to specify which dataset columns can be accessed through the user interface, streamlining column selection within their applications.

## Data Extraction and Data Merging

To delve into the process of selecting specific data columns, please consult the [Data Extraction](data-extract.html)  vignette.

For comprehensive information regarding data merging, please refer to the [Data Merge](data-merge.html) vignette.

To explore the combined use of data extraction and merging, please explore the [Combining data-extract with data-merge](data-extract-merge.html) vignette.
