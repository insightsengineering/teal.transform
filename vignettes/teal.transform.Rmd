## Introduction

`teal.transform` is a package in the `teal` framework which provides:

- `teal` module developers a way to standardize the UI for selecting columns from datasets and to merge datasets
to create an analysis dataset to be used inside their module
- `teal` application developers a way to specify which columns of their datasets can be used in the UI for selecting
columns in their applications

## Data Extract and Data Merge

For information about selecting columns of data see the [data extract](data-extract.html) vignette.
For more information about merging data see the [data merge](data-merge.html) vignette.
For more information about using the extraction and merge together see the [data merge](data-extract-merge.html) vignette.
